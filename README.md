# i3 Molokai with gome-flashback

i3 Molokia Theme with gnome-flashback.
Why gnome-flashback? Because it does support me with the sound, display and bluetooth configuration and supports thinks like dynamically changing the display in case I take my notebook out of the docking station.

## Current setup

* **OS:** Fedora 29
* **Shell:** Bash
* **WM:** i3-gaps with gnome-flashback
* **Bar:** i3blocks
* **Theme:** Molokai
* **Terminal:** gnome-terminal
